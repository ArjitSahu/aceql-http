Introduction
------------

AceQL HTTP is a library of REST like http APIs that allow to access to 
remote SQL databases over http from any device that supports http. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with two client SDK.
- The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls 
  in their code, just like they would for a local database.

  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.

Security has been taken into account from the design: It as allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases.
