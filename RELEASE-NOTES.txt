                    Version 1.0
                    Release Notes


Introduction
------------

AceQL HTTP is a secure framework of REST like HTTP APIs that allow to 
access to remote SQL databases over HTTP from any device that supports HTTP. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with two client SDKs:
- The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls 
  in their code, just like they would for a local database.
- The AceQL C# Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using Microsoft SQL 
  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.

Security has been taken into account from the design: It as allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases.

------------------------------------

What's new:
- Java 9 is now fully supported on Linux.
- DefaultDatabaseConfigurator.getConnectionMaxAge() returns now 0
  for consistency with other APIs.
- Dependencies have been updated.
- As Beta period is expired, AceQL HTTP Professional requires now
  a 30-day license key.

Bugs fixed:
- Setting DatabaseConfigurator.getConnectionMaxAge() to 0 was
  not taken into account by internal code. This has been fixed.

AceQL HTTP Version 1.0-beta-5 - 13-sep-2017
-------------------------------------------

What's New:

- The signature of DatabaseConfigurator.login method has been changed 
  and has 2 more parameters: database and ipAddress.
  This allows implementation code to know to which database the 
  client wants to connect and to get IP address of client if
  necessary for security reasons.
  
- Thus, the previous 1.0-beta-4 DatabaseConfigurator implementations 
  are  not compatible with this 1.0-beta-5 version: the login method 
  signature must be changed.

- The org.kawanfw.sql.api.server.util.HttpServletRequestStore and 
  org.kawanfw.sql.api.server.util.ServerInfo have been suppressed.
  The methods were useless.
  
- The Tomcat dependencies have been updated to in order to use last 
  8.5.20 version.
  
- The property sslConnector.keyAlias must now be defined for SSL 
  activation. This is imposed by Tomcat version 8.5.20.

- Windows version: the JDBC Drivers installation is now done with 
  a "Browse" or paste/copy of files.
  
Bugs fixed:

- Windows version: the console could display warnings and hang.
  This has been fixed.
- Miscellaneous Javadoc errors.

  through a provided Window interface.
  
- Windows: Server run may be configured as a Windows service. Configuration
  & start/stop is done through the provided Windows interface.

- A default servlet is provided for JDBC pools query and update while server 
  is running. See conf/aceql-server.properties file.

Bugs fixed:

- The bound Web port was not correctly released at AceQL server stop for reuse
  in the same JVM. This has been fixed.
