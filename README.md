<a href="https://www.aceql.com">AceQL HTTP</a> is a library of REST like http APIs that allow to access to 
remote SQL databases over http from any device that supports HTTP. 

AceQL HTTP is provided with two client SDK.
* The AceQL Java Client SDK allows to wrap the HTTP APIs using JDBC calls 
  in their code, just like they would for a local database.

  Server like calls in their code, just like they would for a local database.

The SDKs are licensed under Apache 2.0: you can use them in your commercial

Security has been taken into account from the design: It as allowed to specify 
and code strong security rules in order to protect the databases.
